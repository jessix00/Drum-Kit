# Drum-Kit
I took the original idea and starter files from Wes Bos' JavaScript30 challange. I'm completing the challange
on my own while also adding a few custom changes. 

## Getting started:
Download the starter files from [This repository](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit) 
and edit with your favorite text editor.

## Tech Used:
* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
